A script based on kwsch's [pkNX](https://github.com/kwsch/pkNX) project, specifically ported from [Structures/Text/TextFile.cs](https://github.com/kwsch/pkNX/blob/master/pkNX.Structures/Text/TextFile.cs).

read_swsh reads the encoded data from Pok√©mon games. The script returns table labels, the label's FNV1_64 hash, and the text entry associated with the given files.
